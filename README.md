# Monti-Hall
 
####Monti hall is a tricky probability game. It does not make sense until you put in to the code. 
#####This is a scenario:  
1. You are at the game show. 
1. There are 3 doors with 2 goats and 1 car behind. 
1. You choose a door. 
2. Then the host opens another door where the goat is behind and asks, ' Do you want to change the door? '. 

This seems like the probability of the remaining two doors are same. However, this project shows that changing the door is about 2 times higher to get a car than staying at the first choice of the door.
Therefore, you must change your choice to be in a higher probability of winning the car.
