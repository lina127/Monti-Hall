Monti hall is a probability puzzle. 
Monti hall is a probability puzzle.
You are at the game show. There are 3 doors and there are 2 goats and 1 car behind. You choose a door. Then the host opens another door where the goat is behind and asks, ' Do you want to change the door? '. 

This seems like the probability of the remaining two doors are same. However, this project shows that changing the door is about 2 times higher to get a car than staying at the first choice of the door.
Therefore, you must change your choice to be in a higher probability to win a car.
