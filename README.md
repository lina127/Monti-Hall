# Monti-Hall
 
#### Monti hall is a tricky probability game. It does not make sense until you put in to the code. 
##### Here is the scenario:  
1. You are at the game show. 
1. 2 goats and 1 car are behind the 3 doors. 
1. You pick a door. 
2. The host opens another door where the goat is behind and asks, ' Do you want to change the door? '.  
  
This seems like the probability of remaining two doors are same. 50% each.  
However, this project shows that changing the door is about 2 times higher(66%) to get a car than staying at your first choice of the door(33%).  
Therefore, you must change your choice to be in a higher probability of winning the car.
